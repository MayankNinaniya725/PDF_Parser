# PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

**Project Name:** PDF Data Extraction and Management System  
**Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### System Description
This project involves the development of a comprehensive PDF data extraction and management system with the following key components:
- **Backend:** Django-based web application with PostgreSQL database
- **Frontend:** Web-based user interface for PDF upload and data management
- **Processing:** Automated extraction engine using OCR and pattern recognition
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized deployment with Celery for background processing and Redis for task queuing

### Primary Purpose
The system is designed to:
- Extract structured data fields (Heat No, Plate No, Certificate No, etc.) from steel industry test certificates
- Support multiple vendor formats (JSW, POSCO, Hengrun, Iraeta, CITIC, etc.)
- Store extracted data in a structured database format
- Provide file management capabilities including bulk downloads and Excel exports
- Offer a web-based admin interface for data visualization and management
